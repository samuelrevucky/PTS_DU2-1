REVIEW

Since your project doesn't really have any logic or functional code, there is not much to review.
I commend your use of Kotlin.
I also like that you use interfaces for all crucial classes, and your package structure generally.
My advice is to not implement factories for all crucial classes as you are planning (I assume), only for Stop and Line classes.
And finally, don't forget to create the database part of the project and README ;)
